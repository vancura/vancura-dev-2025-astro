# The Web Actor Programming Model Whitepaper

**This whitepaper describes a new concept for building serverless microapps called **_Actors_**, which are easy to develop, share, integrate, and build upon. Actors are a reincarnation of the UNIX philosophy for programs running in the cloud.**

## Introduction

This whitepaper introduces **_Actors_**, a new kind of serverless programs for general-purpose language-agnostic computing and automation jobs (also known as agents, functions, apps, ...). The main goal for Actors is to make it easy for developers to build and ship reusable software tools, which are also easy to run and integrate by others. For example, Actors are useful for building web scrapers, crawlers, automations, and AI agents.

### Background

The Actors were first introduced by [Apify](https://apify.com/) in late 2017, as a way to easily build, package, and ship web scraping and web automation tools to customers. Over the years, Apify has continued to develop the concept and applied it successfully to thousands of real-world use cases in many business areas, well beyond the domain of web scraping.

Building on this experience, we're releasing this whitepaper to introduce the philosophy of Actors to the public and receive your feedback on it. We aim to establish the Actor programming model as an open standard, which will help community to more effectively build and ship reusable software automation tools, as well as encourage new implementations of the model in other programming languages.

The goal of this whitepaper is to be the north star showing what the Actor programming model is and what its implementations should support. Currently, the most complete implementation of Actor model is provided by the Apify platform, with SDKs for [Node.js](https://sdk.apify.com/) and [Python](https://pypi.org/project/apify/), and a [command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.apify.com/cli). Beware that the frameworks might not yet implement all the features of Actor programming model described in this whitepaper. This is work in progress.

### Overview

Actors are serverless programs that run in the cloud. They can perform anything from simple actions such as filling out a web form or sending an email, to complex operations such as crawling an entire website, or removing duplicates from a large dataset. Actors can persist their state and be restarted, and thus they can run as short or as long as necessary, from seconds to hours, even infinitely.

Basically, Actors are programs packaged as Docker images, which accept a well-defined JSON input, perform an action, and optionally produce a well-defined JSON output.

Actors have the following elements:

- **Dockerfile** which specifies where is the Actor's source code, how to build it, and run it.
- **Documentation** in a form of README.md file.
- **Input and output schemas** that describe what input the Actor requires, and what results it produces.
- Access to an out-of-box **storage system** for Actor data, results, and files.
- **Metadata** such as the Actor name, description, author, and version.

The documentation and the input/output schemas make it possible for people to easily understand what the Actor does, enter the required inputs both in user interface or API, and integrate the results of the Actor into their other workflows. Actors can easily call and interact with each other, enabling building more complex systems on top of simple ones.
